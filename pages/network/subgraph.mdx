# Subgraph

Subgraphs are open-source, configurable indexing tools that allow developers to extract, organize, and serve blockchain data through a standardized GraphQL API. By defining the data schema and mappings, subgraphs enable applications to query blockchain events and state changes with speed and precision—making them essential components for building responsive, data-rich Web3 experiences.


## 0xgraph
